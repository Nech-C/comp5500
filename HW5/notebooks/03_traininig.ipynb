    "Think about how you can pre-process the data (in terms of modifying the text). Provde three ideas and explain why you think they are useful or not. Think about the size of the data, tokenization method (we will use character-level language model), your computational resources, and what kind of text you want to generate. Make this answer as extensive as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Your answer:*** \n",
    "1. Convert all characters into lowercase. This can reduce the size of the vocabulary by 26 without too much loss of information. Capitalization has two primary use cases here: start of the sentence capitalization and proper nouns. The first function can be replaced by other punctuation or special characters, and the second function doesn't seem to be necessary since we can recognize the names and places without capitalization.\n",
    "2. Remove newline characters and replace them with a special token when necessary. We don't need a newline character after every \":\" and dialogue line. So instead of  \n",
    "   \"\\<person1\\>: <span style=\"color:red\">\\n</span>  \n",
    "   \\<some words\\><span style=\"color:red\">\\n</span>  \n",

    "   This not only reduces the size of the corpus but also preserves the separation between dialogue lines.\n",
    "3. The text contains special symbols, such as \"$\" and \"&\", but the uses don't make much sense. For example, I found the following in the text:  \n",
    "   a. \"Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,\"  \n",
    "   b. \"England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.\"  \n",
    "The single occurrence of \"$\" seems to be a typo for the letter 'l', so we can just replace \"$\" with \"l.\" The symbol '&' appears only three times, and every occurrence is followed by a letter \"c.\" \"&c\" stands for \"et cetera,\" so we can replace \"&c\" with \"etc.\" By performing those two substitutions, we further reduce the vocabulary size by 2."

    "In PyTorch, `F.cross_entropy` expects the logits to be of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)` and the targets to be of shape `(batch_size,)` containing the class indices. In our case, the logits tensor has the shape `(batch_size, seq_len, num_classes)` and the targets are of shape `(batch_size, seq_len)`. We need to reshape the input and the targets to make them compatible with `F.cross_entropy`. You can do it like this:\n",
